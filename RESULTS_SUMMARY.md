## 📚 Theoretical Background

### **ResNet Paper Key Points:**
- Deep networks suffer from vanishing gradients
- Skip connections provide "gradient highways"
- Identity mapping is easier to learn than complex mappings
- Enables training of 50-152 layer networks

### **Transfer Learning Theory:**
- Features learned on large datasets generalize well
- Lower layers capture generic features (edges, textures)
- Higher layers capture task-specific features
- Fine-tuning adapts general features to specific tasks

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Reports

### **What Makes a Good Analysis:**
1. **Quantitative Evidence**: Use specific numbers from your results
2. **Theoretical Connection**: Link observations to ResNet/transfer learning theory
3. **Mechanistic Explanation**: Explain HOW the techniques work
4. **Real-world Relevance**: Discuss practical implications
5. **Critical Thinking**: Compare approaches and discuss trade-offs

### **Example Analysis Statement:**
*"The residual network achieved 89.3% validation accuracy compared to 76.8% for the standard network, representing a 16.3% improvement. This improvement stems from skip connections providing direct gradient paths to earlier layers, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem that typically occurs in deep networks. The smoother training curves (Figure 1) demonstrate more stable optimization, enabling the network to learn more complex representations without suffering from gradient degradation."*
